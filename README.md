# Future Plans:
- add Dakuon
- add Kanji
- add typing mode
- add romaji to characters ( currently, characters to romaji )
- add some backend service? like login or competing with other users?
- let "mixed" mode customized by user, like selecting which types they wanted

# How to setup locally
- ### Set-up: 
  - npm i 
  - npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node @types/express
  - npx tsc --init

- ### Run:
  - npm run dev - run dev mode and compile app.ts into bundle 
  - npx tsc - compile all typescript files (mainly for index.ts)
  - npm start - run the web server (recommend using this instead of "Open with Live Server")
